# RESTAURANT API TESTING EXAMPLE WHIT JUNIT & MOCKITO

Example testing a real API provided by a fictional employer, and you need to test some already implemented services and controllers.

>**What it really matters to test it's the business stuff, so the porpoise in this case**
**it's only to test the business-side software (the API, that includes**
**the Controllers and the Services).**
